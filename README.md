# monte-carlo-var-simulator

This is a C++ implementation for a Monte-Carlo Value at Risk simulation engine used to simulate risk factors on a portfolio of assets.


## Day 1

Implement TimeSeriesHandler and ReturnType enumerator class.

The TimeSeriesHandler should:

- generate a covariance matrix 
- generate spot rates 
- transform to returns,
- compute covariance for two risk-factors
