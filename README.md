# monte-carlo-var-simulator

This is a C++ implementation for a Monte-Carlo Value at Risk simulation engine used to simulate risk factors on a portfolio of assets.


## Notes

#### Const functions

A "const function", denoted with the keyword const after a function declaration, makes it a compiler error for this class function to change a member variable of the class. 

#### Signed versus unsigned numbers

Signed numbers use sign flag or can be distinguish between negative values and positive values. Unsigned numbers store only positive numbers.

## Day 1

Implement TimeSeriesHandler and ReturnType enumerator class.

The TimeSeriesHandler should:

- generate a covariance matrix 
- generate spot rates 
- transform to returns,
- compute covariance for two risk-factors
